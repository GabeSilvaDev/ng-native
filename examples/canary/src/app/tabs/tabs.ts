/**
 * A native tab bar: `UITabBarController` on iOS, a bottom navigation bar on Android.
 *
 * The tabs are declared here, the way a page declares its `<native-header>`: each `<native-tab>`
 * is one bar item and the screen behind it, and `path` names the child route it selects. The
 * badge is a signal, which is the thing that made the template the right place for this - a count
 * of unread anything changes, and route configuration does not.
 *
 * The outer header is hidden because this page is itself a screen on the app's stack, and the
 * library tab brings its own stack with its own headers. Two headers over one screen is what you
 * get otherwise.
