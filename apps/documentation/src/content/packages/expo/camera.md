summary: <expo-camera> on screen, and a picture taken from it without a React ref.

# Camera

`ImagePicker.capture()` (see [Image picker](/packages/expo/image-picker)) opens the system camera
over your app. For a camera inside your own screen - a scanner, a custom shutter - register the
`<expo-camera>` view and import the `Camera` directive, which applies to every `<expo-camera>` in
the template.

## Install

```sh
npx expo install expo-camera
```

```ts
import { Camera } from '@ng-native/expo/camera';
```

## The smallest thing that works

```ts
import { Component, viewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { Pressable, Text } from '@ng-native/components';
import { Permission, registerExpoViews } from '@ng-native/expo';
import { Camera } from '@ng-native/expo/camera';
import * as ExpoCamera from 'expo-camera';

registerExpoViews('expo-camera'); // once, before the app mounts

@Component({
  selector: 'app-shutter',
  imports: [Camera, Pressable, Text],
  template: `
    @if (permission.granted()) {
      <expo-camera facing="back" class="flex-1" />
      <pressable (press)="shoot()"><text>Take picture</text></pressable>
    } @else if (permission.blocked()) {
      <text>Enable camera access in Settings to take a picture.</text>
    } @else {
      <pressable (press)="permission.ensure()"><text>Allow camera access</text></pressable>
    }
  `,
})
export class Shutter {
  private readonly camera = viewChild(Camera);
  protected readonly permission = Permission.of(
    ExpoCamera.Camera.getCameraPermissionsAsync,
    ExpoCamera.Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync,
  );

  protected async shoot(): Promise<void> {
    const picture = await this.camera()?.takePicture({ quality: 0.8 });
    if (picture) console.log(picture.uri, picture.width, picture.height);
  }
}
```

The camera renders only once `permission.granted()` is true, and `shoot()` is only reachable from
that branch. `permission.blocked()` is the state where the platform will not show its own dialog
again - `ensure()` would resolve to the same refusal without asking - so that branch sends the
user to Settings instead of retrying.

## Registering the view

`<expo-camera>` is not registered by default. Call `registerExpoViews('expo-camera')` once at
startup, before the first commit that uses the element - it teaches the engine the Fabric
component name for `expo-camera`'s view. `expo-camera` registers as the module's _default_ view
(the Fabric name is `ViewManagerAdapter_ExpoCamera`, with no view name suffix), because the camera
is the only view the module renders.

## The camera permission

The view needs the camera permission before it shows anything. Nothing in `Camera` asks for it -
the directive only takes pictures - so ask yourself, with `Permission.of()` against
`expo-camera`'s own permission functions (see [Permissions](/packages/expo/permissions)):

```ts
protected readonly permission = Permission.of(
  ExpoCamera.Camera.getCameraPermissionsAsync,
  ExpoCamera.Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync,
);
```

Add to `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow this app to access your camera</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow this app to access your microphone</string>
```

The `CAMERA` (and, for video with audio, `RECORD_AUDIO`) Android permissions are added
automatically by the module's config plugin.

## Taking a picture

**`takePicture(options)`** takes `expo-camera`'s own `CameraPictureOptions` (minus
`onPictureSaved` and `pictureRef`, which do not apply here) and resolves to a
`CameraCapturedPicture` - `uri`, `width`, `height`, and `base64` or `exif` if asked for. It
resolves to **null** before the view has reached the screen, or without the module.

In React, `takePictureAsync` is a method on the camera component's ref. Underneath, it is one of
the functions Expo defines on the view itself (`AsyncFunction('takePicture')` in the native
module), which native finds by reading the tag off whatever it is called on. `Camera` calls that
same function with the tag the engine committed the view under, so no ref is needed - `takePicture`
is a method on the directive instance a `viewChild` reaches.
