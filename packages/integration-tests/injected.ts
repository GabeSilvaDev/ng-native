/**
 * Building a service outside an app.
 *
 * Every service in `@ng-native/device` and `@ng-native/expo` reaches its platform
 * through an injected source token, so a fake stands in for the platform by being provided rather
 * than passed. That is also the only way to construct one: `inject()` needs an injection context,
 * and `new Keyboard()` on its own throws.
 *
 * This is the two lines that gives you one, so a test reads as `serviceWith(SOURCE, fake, () =>
 * new Thing())` rather than restating the injector each time.
