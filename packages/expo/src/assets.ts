/**
 * `assets()`, bound to `expo-asset`. Images downloaded before they are needed.
 *
 * ```ts
 * protected readonly hero = assets(() => [require('./hero.png')]);
 *
 * // <image [source]="hero.value()?.[0]" />
 * // @if (hero.isLoading()) { <skeleton /> }
 * ```
 *
 * `useAssets()` is a hook around `Asset.loadAsync`, which is already a plain promise - so what is
 * worth having is not a wrapper but the reason the hook exists: a screen that shows an image
 * bundled with the app still has to wait for it the first time, and a splash screen or a skeleton
 * is only useful if something says when the wait is over.
 *
 * That is `resource()`, exactly. It is per call site for the same reason the hook is: two screens
 * loading different pictures are two separate waits, and a singleton holding one `loaded` signal
 * would have the second screen's load answer the first's. An app that wants assets warmed before
 * there is an injector at all calls `Asset.loadAsync` itself - there is nothing here to add.
