/**
 * `AppleSignIn`, bound to `expo-apple-authentication`: Sign in with Apple, which the App Store
 * requires of an app that offers another social sign-in. iOS only; everywhere else, and without
 * the module installed, `available()` answers false and every call answers null.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { AppleAuthenticationScope, AppleSignIn } from '@ng-native/expo/apple-sign-in';
 *
 * private readonly apple = inject(AppleSignIn);
 *
 * async signIn(): Promise<void> {
 *   const credential = await this.apple.signIn({
 *     requestedScopes: [AppleAuthenticationScope.FULL_NAME, AppleAuthenticationScope.EMAIL],
 *   });
 *   if (credential) await this.session.start(credential.identityToken);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The button Apple's guidelines ask for is `<apple-sign-in-button>`, in
 * `./apple-sign-in-button.ts`.
 *
 * A sign-in the user cancels answers null rather than throwing: closing the sheet is an ordinary
 * answer, not a failure, and every caller would otherwise have to tell `ERR_REQUEST_CANCELED` apart
 * from a real error itself.
