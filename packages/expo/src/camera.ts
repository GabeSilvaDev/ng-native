/**
 * `Camera`: a picture taken from the `<expo-camera>` view on screen.
 *
 * ```ts
 * registerExpoViews('expo-camera'); // once, at startup
 *
 * @Component({
 *   imports: [Camera],
 *   template: `<expo-camera facing="back" class="flex-1" />`,
 * })
 * export class Scanner {
 *   private readonly camera = viewChild.required(Camera);
 *   async shoot() { const picture = await this.camera().takePicture({ quality: 0.8 }); }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Importing it is all it takes: it applies to every `<expo-camera>` in the template. The view is
 * what takes the picture, so this is a directive on the view rather than a service.
 *
 * In React, `takePictureAsync` is a method on the component's ref. Underneath, it is one of the
 * functions Expo defines on the view (`AsyncFunction("takePicture")` in the module), which native
 * finds by reading `nativeTag` off whatever it is called on. So this calls the same function with
 * the tag the engine committed the view under, and no ref is needed.
