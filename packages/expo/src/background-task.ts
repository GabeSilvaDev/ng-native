/**
 * `BackgroundTask`, bound to `expo-background-task`: work the platform runs while the app is in
 * the background.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // main.ts, at the top level, outside Angular
 * TaskManager.defineTask('sync', async () => {
 *   await syncNotes();
 *   return BackgroundTaskResult.Success;
 * });
 *
 * // anywhere in the app
 * private readonly tasks = inject(BackgroundTask);
 * if ((await this.tasks.status()) === BackgroundTaskStatus.Available) {
 *   await this.tasks.register('sync', { minimumInterval: 60 });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The task itself is defined with `expo-task-manager` at the top level of `main.ts`: the platform
 * runs it by loading the bundle and evaluating the entry module without bootstrapping Angular, so
 * it can reach no component and no service from `inject()`. This service is the part the app
 * does: registering the task, unregistering it, and asking whether the platform will run
 * background work at all. The platform decides when a registered task runs - WorkManager on
 * Android, BGTaskScheduler on iOS - and the interval is a minimum, not a schedule.
 *
 * Without the module installed, the status is restricted and registering does nothing. The
 * module's expiration listener is not here: it is for the task's own body, which runs outside
 * Angular.
