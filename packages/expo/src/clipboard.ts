 * both a terrible experience and a good way to have the read denied. So the notification is free
 * and the read is explicit.
 *
 * The listener lives as long as the app does, and is removed when the app is destroyed: a root
 * service is one per app, not one per process, and an app that is mounted and unmounted - by a
 * test, a reload, a host embedding it - would otherwise leave one listener behind each time.
