/**
 * `Locale`, bound to `expo-localization`.
 *
 * Both getters are synchronous, so unlike the other device services there is no default to sit at.
 * What makes this worth a service is that the answers *change*: a user can switch language in
 * Settings and come back, and a date that was formatted correctly is then wrong. The module's
 * hooks subscribe to that; nothing else does.
 *
 * The list is ordered by preference and always has at least one entry, which is the whole reason
 * to prefer it over a single locale string: an app that supports the user's second language should
 * use it rather than fall back to English.
