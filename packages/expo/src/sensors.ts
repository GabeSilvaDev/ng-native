/**
 * The motion sensors, bound to `expo-sensors`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * private readonly motion = inject(Accelerometer);
 *
 * constructor() {
 *   inject(DestroyRef).onDestroy(this.motion.start(50));
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Every one of them is the same object - `addListener`, `setUpdateInterval`, `isAvailableAsync` -
 * so this is one class parameterised by the reading, not one per sensor. Six services sharing one
 * class is why these are tokens rather than six decorated classes: a `@Service` class cannot be
 * generic in the thing it reports.
 *
 * Nothing is subscribed until `start`, and the interval is explicit: the sensible one is a
 * property of what the app is doing - a compass wants a tenth of a second, a shake detector less -
 * and every event is a change-detection pass, so a sensor left at its default is a phone that
 * never idles.
