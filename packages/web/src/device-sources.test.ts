/**
 * `Screen`, answered by the browser rather than by the fallback that means "no device".
 *
 * `@ng-native/device`'s factories all degrade to doing nothing off a device, which is what
 * makes the package importable by a test suite and what made it quietly wrong here: `mount`
 * provided nothing in their place, so `Screen` reported a window of zero by zero on every page.
 *
 * `compact()` is `width < 768`, so zero meant every component that branches on it took the phone
 * tree - the sidebar rendered its mobile sheet instead of its rail in a 1200pt browser window -
 * and `anchored-overlay.ts` fitted every popover against a zero-sized screen. Neither said a word.
 *
 * Found by opening the gallery, not by reading, and it could only have been found that way: the
 * tests that mount through `mount` had never asked what size the window was.
