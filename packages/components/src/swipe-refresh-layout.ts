/**
 * The Android half of `<refresh-control>`: make its swipe layout the scroll view's parent.
 *
 * `ScrollView.js` does it with `cloneElement(refreshControl, {style: outer}, <NativeScrollView
 * style={inner}>)`. `AndroidSwipeRefreshLayout` is a `ViewGroup` that pulls on its one child;
 * committed inside the scroll view instead, it has no child to pull on and a pull does nothing.
 *
 * The templates cannot say it, because the refresh control is content of the scroll view, so the
 * engine nodes are moved instead: the swipe layout goes where the scroll view was, the scroll view
 * goes inside it, and an anchor, which never reaches Fabric, marks the spot to put it back.
 *
 * `sync` is idempotent and cheap when nothing moved, so it runs after every pass. That is also
 * what repairs the shape when Angular moves the scroll view itself, say in a reordered `@for`:
 * Angular re-inserts the node it knows about, and the next pass wraps it again where it landed.
 *
 * The style is split the same way RN splits it. The inline style Angular writes to the scroll view
 * is read, the layout keys go to the swipe layout over the scroll view's base style, and the
 * scroll view keeps the rest. A moved key is left on the scroll view as `null`, or as its base
 * value for `flexGrow` and `flexShrink`, rather than deleted: Angular only removes a style key
 * that is still there, so a deleted one could never be taken off the swipe layout again.
 *
 * ponytail: only inline style is split. Layout that reaches the scroll view from a class stays on
 * the scroll view inside the swipe layout, which fills it anyway.
