 * A bar that sits on the keyboard: a chat's composer, a comment box, a row of formatting keys.
 * At the bottom of its parent, clear of the home indicator or navigation bar, while the keyboard
 * is down; on top of it while it is up.
 *
 * On iOS with react-native-keyboard-controller (`provideKeyboardController()`), the bar is moved
 * by the keyboard's height on the native side, frame by frame, the way UIKit carries an input
 * accessory: as the keyboard rises and falls, and while a finger drags it down through a scroll
 * view with `keyboardDismissMode="interactive"`, where iOS reports no keyboard frames to
 * JavaScript at all. The drag takes the keyboard from the top of the bar rather than the top of
 * the keyboard, as Messages does, and a short one springs it back up. `keyboardLift` moves
 * content above with it.
 *
 * Without it, and on Android, the bar is padded by as much of the keyboard as covers it, which it
 * learns as the keyboard starts to move; a window the system resized for the keyboard already
 * puts it clear, and then it is not padded at all.
 *
 * `covered()` is how much of the bottom of the screen the keyboard covers beyond the dock's own
 * place, for content above that keeps clear of it with padding or an inset rather than moving.
