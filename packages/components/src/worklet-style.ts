/**
 * A style computed on the UI thread, by a Reanimated worklet.
 *
 * The difference from `AnimatedStyle` is where the work happens. An animated style advances in
 * JavaScript unless the native driver can take the whole animation over, and the native driver
 * only understands the animations React Native itself can express. A worklet is arbitrary code
 * running on a second JavaScript runtime that lives on the UI thread, so anything computable per
 * frame - a gesture following a finger, a value derived from three others - keeps its frame rate
 * with the JavaScript thread busy.
 *
 * `WorkletStyle` in `../reanimated.ts` is the one apps import: same selector, and it supplies the
 * real runtime itself.
