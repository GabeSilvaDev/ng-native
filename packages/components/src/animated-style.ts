/**
 * Binds a style holding animated values to the element it sits on: the Angular equivalent of
 * React Native's `createAnimatedComponent`.
 *
 * ```html
 * <view [animatedStyle]="{ opacity: fade, transform: [{ translateY: slide }] }">
 * ```
 *
 * Two drivers, and the difference is where the work happens. With `useNativeDriver: true` the
 * whole animation runs on the UI thread: this hands the graph the element's react tag once and
 * then does nothing per frame, so the animation keeps its frame rate with the JavaScript thread
 * blocked. Without it, every frame calls back here and is written to the node. A browser has only
 * the second kind: `animations-web.ts` supplies a graph that is JavaScript-driven throughout, and
 * `useNativeDriver` there changes nothing.
 *
 * A JavaScript frame commits outside change detection, one of the two exceptions to committing at
 * most once per change-detection pass (the other is a CSS transition). It has to: the graph advances on its own schedule, and waiting for the next change
 * detection pass would drop the frame. The commit is incremental like any other, and touches
 * only the nodes the frame changed.
