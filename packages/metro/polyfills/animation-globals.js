/**
 * The globals Angular's `animate.enter` and `animate.leave` look for, and nothing else.
 *
 * Both instructions are gated on a module-level constant in `@angular/core`:
 *
 *     const areAnimationSupported =
 *       typeof document !== 'undefined' &&
 *       typeof document?.documentElement?.getAnimations === 'function';
 *
 * It is evaluated the moment `@angular/core` is imported, so this file has to run first, which is
 * why it is a polyfill rather than a module the platform imports. Without it both instructions
 * compile to no-ops and an `animate.leave` element simply disappears with no animation.
 *
 * There is no DOM here, and the point of this file is that there does not have to be. Angular
 * runs the animations themselves entirely through `Renderer2` - `addClass`, `removeClass`, and
 * `listen` for the transition events - all of which this project implements. What it also does is
 * ask the element how long its animation lasts, via `getAnimations()`, and check a few global
 * types on the way past. Those are what this supplies: the engine answers `getAnimations()` from
 * the transitions it is actually running.
 *
 * The one risk of defining `document` is Angular's internal `getDocument()`, which falls back to
 * the global. Its five callers are hydration, two sanitiser paths and a style host that prefers
 * the injected `DOCUMENT` token; none is on this renderer's path.
