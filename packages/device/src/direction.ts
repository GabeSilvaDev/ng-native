/**
 * Which way round the world is: left to right, or right to left.
 *
 * The cascade already mirrors the *paint*. `direction: rtl` flips padding, text alignment and the
 * order boxes are laid out in, and Yoga inherits that down the shadow tree without anyone asking,
 * so a stylesheet needs nothing from this file.
 *
 * What the cascade cannot do is tell TypeScript which way round the world is, and this library
 * computes position in TypeScript in several places: `anchor.ts` resolves an `align` of `start`
 * against an edge, the slider maps a drag's x delta onto a value, and the drawer, the sheet and
 * the sidebar all name an edge. Every one of those is a decision made before a style exists, so
 * every one of them needs an answer here rather than in CSS. It is the same reason Angular's CDK
 * ships `Directionality` rather than leaving direction to the stylesheet.
 *
 * A directive can override it for a subtree the way `[dir]` does, by providing a
 * `DirectionContext` in `Direction`'s place.
