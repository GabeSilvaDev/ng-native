/**
 * Android's hardware back button.
 *
 * Not a signal, because a press is a question rather than a state: the platform asks whether
 * anybody wants it, and the answer decides what happens next. A handler returns whether it
 * consumed the press, and returning false lets the platform do what it would have done - at the
 * bottom of a navigation stack that means backgrounding the app rather than closing it, so a user
 * who backs out of the first screen finds the app where they left it.
