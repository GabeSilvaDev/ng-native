/**
 * How much of the screen belongs to the system: the notch, the status bar, the home indicator,
 * a rounded corner, and on Android the display cutout and the navigation bar.
 *
 * Unlike everything else here, this has no React Native module behind it. Insets are a property
 * of a *view*, not of the device, and the only thing that can report them is a native view inside
 * the window - `<safe-area-provider>` in `@ng-native/components`, which pushes what it
 * measures in here. That is also why the values start at zero: nothing is known until a view has
 * been laid out, which is one frame after the app mounts.
 *
 * Most layouts should not read this at all. A `<safe-area-view>` applies the insets natively,
 * without a round trip through JavaScript, and a screen in a native stack has its header do it.
 * This is for the cases neither covers: a floating button that must clear the home indicator, a
 * scroll view whose content inset is computed, a sheet drawing its own chrome.
