 * What the user has turned on in the system's accessibility settings.

 * cannot make: not animating when the user asked for less motion, announcing something that
 * changed off screen, giving a screen reader a different affordance than a finger gets.
 *
 * Every value starts at its neutral setting and is corrected once the platform answers, because
 * React Native reports all three asynchronously. A first paint therefore assumes nothing is on.
