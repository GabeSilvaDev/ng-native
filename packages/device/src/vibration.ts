/**
 * Vibration, which is not haptics.
 *
 * `Haptics` is the Taptic Engine: a tap, a nudge, a success chime you feel rather than hear, tied
 * to something the user just did. This is the motor - a buzz of a stated length, or a pattern -
 * and it is what an alarm, a timer or an incoming call uses. An app that wants feedback for a
 * button press wants the other one.
 *
 * iOS has one duration and ignores the number, so a pattern there is on and off at a fixed
 * strength; Android takes the milliseconds as written. Both are said plainly rather than papered
 * over, because a pattern designed on Android does not feel the same on iOS and nothing here can
 * make it.
